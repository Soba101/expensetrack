## 🚀 Next Development Phase

### Immediate Priority: Receipt Upload Flow
The next logical step is to complete the receipt upload functionality:

1. **Image Processing**: Convert selected images to proper format for backend
2. **API Integration**: Connect frontend upload to backend `/api/receipts` endpoint
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for upload failures
4. **Progress Feedback**: Upload progress indicators for users

### Following Priorities:
1. **OCR Integration**: Implement text extraction from receipts
2. **Expense Management**: CRUD operations for expense data
3. **Categories**: Expense categorization system
4. **Reporting**: Analytics and insights dashboard

## 🛠 Technical Foundation
