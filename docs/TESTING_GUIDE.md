# Testing Guide

## Backend Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### âœ… Authentication Tests (WORKING)
The authentication system has comprehensive test coverage:

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… User registration with valid data
- âœ… Duplicate username prevention
- âœ… Login with correct credentials
- âœ… Login rejection with invalid credentials
- âœ… JWT token generation and validation
- âœ… Password hashing verification

**Test Results:**
All authentication tests are passing and cover the complete auth flow.

### Test Database
Tests use a separate test database to avoid affecting development data.

## Frontend Testing
