# ExpenseTrack Backend Security Notes

## JWT Secret
- Store your JWT secret in the `.env` file
- Use a long, random string
- Never commit your real secret to version control

## Password Hashing
- User passwords are hashed with bcryptjs before storage
- Never store plain-text passwords

## Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user input
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Restrict JWT token lifetime (currently 1 day)
- Use environment variables for all secrets

# Security Implementation Notes

## âœ… Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication Security (COMPLETED)
- **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with 1-day expiration
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage in AsyncStorage with proper cleanup on logout
- **Input Validation**: Frontend and backend validation for user credentials
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication middleware protecting sensitive endpoints

### Backend Security (COMPLETED)
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (JWT_SECRET, DB credentials) stored in .env
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose system details
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters enforced on frontend and backend

### Database Security (COMPLETED)
- **Connection Security**: MongoDB connection with authentication
- **Data Validation**: Mongoose schema validation for user data
- **No Plain Text Passwords**: All passwords hashed before storage

## ðŸš§ Security Measures in Development

### API Security (PLANNED)
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Request size limits for file uploads
- API versioning for backward compatibility

### Data Security (PLANNED)
- Encryption for sensitive expense data
- Secure file upload validation
- Data sanitization for OCR text processing

## ðŸ“‹ Future Security Enhancements

### Advanced Authentication
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- OAuth integration (Google, Apple)
- Biometric authentication
- Session management improvements

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Regular security audits
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data backup encryption

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers implementation
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
3. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
4. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies kept up to date
5. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages

## Security Testing

### Current Tests (WORKING)
- âœ… Authentication endpoint security tests
- âœ… Password hashing verification
- âœ… JWT token validation tests
- âœ… Invalid credential handling tests

### Planned Tests
- ðŸ“‹ Rate limiting tests
- ðŸ“‹ File upload security tests
- ðŸ“‹ SQL injection prevention tests
- ðŸ“‹ XSS prevention tests

## Security Monitoring

### Current Monitoring
- Basic error logging
- Authentication failure tracking

### Planned Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Suspicious activity alerts
