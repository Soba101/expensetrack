## ðŸš§ REMAINING TASKS:

### 2. Complete the Receipt Upload Flow:
- Implement logic to convert the selected image URI (from `expo-image-picker`) into a format suitable for sending to the backend (e.g., base64 string or form data).
- Send the image data to your backend's `/api/receipts/` endpoint (as described in `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`).
- Handle the response from the backend (which should include the extracted data after OCR).

### 3. Implement OCR Integration (Backend/Frontend):
- (Backend) Set up or integrate with an OCR service to process the uploaded image.
- (Backend) Parse the OCR results to extract key information like date, amount, vendor, etc.
- (Backend) Send the extracted data back to the frontend in the response.

### 4. Create and Populate the Add/Edit Expense Screen (from Upload):
- When the backend returns extracted data, navigate the user to the `AddEditExpenseScreen`.
- Pre-fill the form fields on the `AddEditExpenseScreen` with the extracted data.
- Allow the user to review and edit the pre-filled data.

### 5. Save Finalized Expense Data:
- On the `AddEditExpenseScreen`, implement the logic to save the finalized expense data (including any manual edits) to the backend API.

### 6. Implement Full Expense Management:
- Display a list of all expenses (beyond the mock data in the Inbox). The `ExpensesListScreen` is likely intended for this.
- Implement viewing details of an existing expense (`ExpenseDetailScreen`).
- Add functionality to edit and delete expenses.

### 7. Develop Categories Feature:
- Implement the `CategoriesScreen` to manage expense categories.
- Allow users to create, view, edit, and delete categories.
- Link expenses to categories.

### 8. Build Reporting and Analytics:
- Develop the `ReportsScreen` to display expense summaries and breakdowns (like the mock data on the Dashboard, but based on real saved expenses).
- Implement filtering and sorting of expenses for reports.
- Consider data export functionality (CSV, PDF).

### 9. Implement Settings Functionality:
- Flesh out the `SettingsScreen` with actual settings options (e.g., managing profile, currency, notifications if applicable).
