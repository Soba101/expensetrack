# Text Input Fix - Testing Instructions

## What was fixed:

1. **Restored proper keyboard dismissal functionality** - The previous "fix" was just commenting out important functionality in the `useKeyboardDismissable.ts` file
2. **Replaced NativeBase Input with React Native TextInput** - This prevents conflicts with keyboard dismissal
3. **Added proper input styling** - Maintains the visual design while using native components

## How to test:

1. **Start the app** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Navigate to Login Screen**:
   - The app should show the login screen by default (if not authenticated)
   - Or navigate to it from the authentication flow

3. **Test Username Input**:
   - Tap on the "Username" input field
   - You should see the cursor appear and stay visible
   - Type some text - the cursor should remain stable
   - Text should appear as you type without the cursor disappearing

4. **Test Password Input**:
   - Tap on the "Password" input field
   - You should see the cursor appear and stay visible
   - Type some text - it should be masked (dots/asterisks)
   - The cursor should remain stable while typing

5. **Test Register Screen**:
   - Navigate to the Register screen
   - Test both input fields the same way
   - Both should work without cursor disappearing

## Key improvements:

- **Stable cursor**: No more disappearing cursor when typing
- **Proper focus management**: Inputs maintain focus correctly
- **Keyboard dismissal works**: You can still dismiss the keyboard by tapping outside
- **Theme support**: Inputs adapt to light/dark mode
- **Better UX**: Added `blurOnSubmit={false}` to prevent premature blur

## Technical details:

- Replaced `native-base` Input components with React Native `TextInput`
- Added proper styling that matches the theme
- Used `blurOnSubmit={false}` to prevent keyboard dismissal conflicts
- Added `autoCapitalize="none"` and `autoCorrect={false}` for better UX
- Maintained responsive design with NativeBase Box wrapper

The solution is now robust and won't be lost when dependencies are updated, unlike the previous temporary fix.
