## Recent Fixes (Latest)

### Authentication & Data Consistency Fix

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Authentication Middleware Duplication**: Removed duplicate auth middleware from individual route files
- **User ID Undefined Error**: Fixed `req.user.id` being undefined due to JWT payload structure mismatch
- **Data Inconsistency**: Resolved discrepancy where categories showed 5 transactions while expenses showed 50

#### Technical Changes:
- **Centralized Auth**: All routes now use `backend/middleware/auth.js`
- **Consistent User ID**: Proper mapping from JWT `userId` to `req.user.id`
- **Flexible Categories Endpoint**: Added `?period=all-time|current-month` query parameter
- **Default Behavior**: Categories endpoint now defaults to all-time data (matching expenses)

#### Before vs After:
```bash
# Before Fix
Categories: 5 transactions (current month only)
Expenses: 50 transactions (all time)

# After Fix  
Categories: 50 transactions (all time by default)
Expenses: 50 transactions (all time)
```

#### Files Modified:
- `backend/routes/expenses.js` - Removed local auth middleware, imported centralized version
- `backend/routes/receipts.js` - Removed local auth middleware, imported centralized version  
- `backend/routes/categories.js` - Added period parameter, defaulted to all-time
- `backend/middleware/auth.js` - Enhanced with better error handling

#### Debug Logging Added:
```bash
üîç GET /api/categories/ - Debug info:
  - Date range (all-time): All expenses included
  - Category "Food & Dining": 14 transactions, $830.02
  - Category "Healthcare": 4 transactions, $1441.91
```

### Backward Compatibility:
- Existing API calls continue to work unchanged
- Optional `?period=current-month` parameter available for monthly budget views
- All authentication flows remain the same

### Testing Verified:
- ‚úÖ User authentication works correctly
- ‚úÖ Categories and expenses show matching transaction counts
- ‚úÖ All CRUD operations function properly
- ‚úÖ Debug logging provides clear troubleshooting information
- ‚úÖ Both all-time and current-month filtering work as expected
