## 📝 API Documentation

### Authentication
All API endpoints require JWT authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Centralized authentication middleware across all routes
- ✅ Consistent `req.user.id` handling 
- ✅ Proper JWT token validation and error handling

### Endpoints

#### Expenses
- `GET /api/expenses` - Get all expenses for authenticated user
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create new expense
- `PUT /api/expenses/:id` - Update expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete expense

#### Categories
- `GET /api/categories` - Get expense categories with statistics
  - **Query Parameters:**
    - `period` (optional): `all-time` (default) | `current-month`
  - **Response:** Categories with spending statistics for specified period
  - **Example:** `GET /api/categories?period=current-month`
- `POST /api/categories` - Create new category
- `PUT /api/categories/:id` - Update category
- `DELETE /api/categories/:id` - Delete category
- `POST /api/categories/initialize` - Initialize default categories for new users
- `POST /api/categories/reorder` - Reorder categories

#### Receipts
- `POST /api/receipts` - Upload and process receipt
- `GET /api/receipts` - Get all receipts for authenticated user
- `GET /api/receipts/:id` - Get specific receipt
- `POST /api/receipts/:id/process` - Process receipt with OCR

#### Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/summary` - Get expense summary and analytics

### Data Consistency
**Recent Fix:** Categories and expenses endpoints now return consistent transaction counts:
- Both endpoints respect the same user authentication
- Categories endpoint defaults to all-time data (matching expenses behavior)
- Optional period filtering available for monthly budget views

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Authentication Issues**
**Problem:** `req.user.id` is undefined in backend logs
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed - All routes now use centralized auth middleware

**Problem:** JWT token errors or malformed tokens
**Solution:** Check token format and ensure proper Bearer prefix

#### **Data Inconsistency**
**Problem:** Categories show different transaction counts than expenses
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed - Categories endpoint now defaults to all-time data

**Problem:** Categories showing 0 transactions despite having expenses
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed - Authentication middleware now properly sets user ID

#### **Development Setup**
**Problem:** Backend not connecting to MongoDB
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or connection string is correct
2. Check environment variables in `.env` file
3. Verify network connectivity

**Problem:** Frontend not connecting to backend
**Solution:**
1. Ensure backend is running on correct port (3001)
2. Check IP address in frontend configuration
3. Verify CORS settings if needed

#### **Debugging Tips**
- **Backend Logs:** Check console for detailed request/response logging
- **Frontend Logs:** Use React Native debugger or console logs
- **Database:** Use MongoDB Compass to inspect data directly
- **Network:** Use network tab in debugger to inspect API calls

### Debug Logging
The backend includes comprehensive debug logging:
```bash
# Example backend logs
🔍 GET /api/expenses/ - Debug info:
  - req.user: { id: '...', email: '...' }
  - Found expenses count: 50

🔍 GET /api/categories/ - Debug info:
  - Date range (all-time): All expenses included
  - Category "Food & Dining": 14 transactions, $830.02
```

**Built with ❤️ using React Native and modern design principles**

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### CategoryManagementScreen Testing
1. **Access the screen**: From Dashboard → tap "Categories" button
2. **Test CRUD operations**:
   - Create new category with custom icon/color
   - Edit existing category details
   - Delete non-default categories
3. **Test search and filtering**:
   - Search for categories by name
   - Sort by name, usage, or budget
4. **Test form validation**:
   - Try creating category with empty name
   - Try duplicate category names
   - Test budget validation (negative values)
5. **Test UI interactions**:
   - Pull to refresh
   - Haptic feedback on all buttons
   - Toast notifications for all actions

## 🔧 **RECENT FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### ✅ **Authentication & Data Consistency Fix (Latest)**
- **Fixed authentication middleware inconsistency** - Centralized auth middleware across all routes
- **Resolved data discrepancy** between expenses and categories endpoints
- **Enhanced categories endpoint** with flexible time period filtering (`?period=all-time|current-month`)
- **Improved error handling** with detailed logging for debugging
- **Consistent user ID handling** across all backend routes

#### **What was fixed:**
1. **Auth Middleware Issue**: Routes had duplicate auth middleware causing `req.user.id` to be undefined
2. **Date Filtering Mismatch**: Categories showed only current month data while expenses showed all-time data
3. **Data Consistency**: Now both endpoints return matching transaction counts

#### **Technical Details:**
- **Before**: Categories endpoint returned 5 transactions (current month only)
- **After**: Categories endpoint returns 50 transactions (all-time by default)
- **Backward Compatible**: Still supports `?period=current-month` for monthly budget views
- **Centralized Auth**: All routes now use `backend/middleware/auth.js`
